A Left 4 Dead 2 store that uses NyxTools
## Installation
* Download and install the latest release of [NyxTools](https://github.com/JeremyDF93/nyxtools).
* Nyxtools conflicts with the [Left4Downtown2](https://github.com/Accelerator74/Left4Downtown2) extension. I recommend not using this extention until I release a compatible patch.
## Configuring
* Edit `catalog.cfg`, `menus.cfg` and `rewards.cfg` to your liking.
* Better documentation detailing all commands, cvars and the config format will be coming soon.
